# Llama3-70B Demo on Galaxy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This model for Galaxy is set for deprecation and will be replaced with a newer one.

## How to Run

1. **Download the Llama3-70B weights from Meta (https://llama.meta.com/):**

2. **Repack the weights:**
    ```bash
    # This concatenates the sharded checkpoints and makes it easier for us to load.
    python models/demos/t3000/llama2_70b/scripts/repack_weights.py <path_to_checkpoint_dir> <repacked_output_dir> <chunk_size>
    ```
    Note: Use `5` for `chunk_size`.

    Once the weights are repacked, move the `params.json` file from the `checkpoint_dir` to the `repacked_output_dir`.

### Running the Demo

After setting up the repacked weights and tokenizer, you can run the demo using the commands below:

1. **Prepare the weight cache directory:**
    ```bash
    # Make a directory for us to cache weights into. This speeds up subsequent runs.
    mkdir <weight_cache_dir>
    ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
    ```bash
    export LLAMA3_CKPT_DIR=<repacked_output_dir>
    export LLAMA3_TOKENIZER_PATH=<path_to_checkpoint_dir> # Path needs to include the tokenizer.model file
    export LLAMA3_CACHE_PATH=<weight_cache_dir>

    export TIKTOKEN_CACHE_DIR=""

    pip install -r models/demos/t3000/llama2_70b/reference/llama/requirements.txt

    # Example:
    # export LLAMA3_CKPT_DIR="/home/llama-data-repacked/llama-3-70b/"
    # export LLAMA3_TOKENIZER_PATH="/home/llama-data-repacked/tokenizer.model"
    # export LLAMA3_CACHE_PATH="/home/llama-data-cache/weights-cache"


    ```

3. **Run the demo:**

    NOTE: Run the following comand twice.
    1. The first run will cache the weights. This will take some time.
    2. The second run will use the cached weights, thereby running much faster.

    Command to run the decode demo using greedy sampling
    ```bash
    pytest models/demos/tg/llama3_70b/demo/demo.py::test_LlamaModel_demo[wormhole_b0-True-short_context-check_disabled-greedy-tt-70b-glx-80L-decode_only-text_completion-llama3-tg-4x8_grid]
    ```

## Details

- **Batch Size:** Supports batch size 16 and 32.
- **Input File:** Uses `models/demos/t3000/llama2_70b/demo/data/multi_prompt.json`.
- **Model Configuration:** Utilizes a pretrained model.
- **Hardware Requirements:** Runs on an 32-chip Galaxy machine using tensor parallelism. The host machine must have at least 512 GB of memory.
- **Model Functionality:**
    - The demo can run in `decode_only` mode in which we use decode mode to consume the context one token at a time. `prefill_decode` mode is not supported yet.

- **Demo arguments:**
    - `context: [short_context, long_context]`: Select between short context (batch 32, sequence_length 2k) and long context (batch 16, sequence length 8k)
    - `ground_truth: [check_disabled, check_enabled]`: Enable or disable ground truth checking, used for testing
    - `sampling: [greedy, sampling]`: Select between greedy decoding and top-k/top-p sampling
    - `implementation: [tt-70b-glx]`: Run the 70B model on the Tenstorrent Galaxy server.
    - `num_layers: [1L, 2L, 10L, 80L]`: Select 80L to run the full model
    - `decode_only: [decode_only,]`: Use `decode_only`, `prefil_decode` mode is not supported yet
    - `chat: [text_completion, chat_completion]`: Run in text_completion mode for the pretrained model or chat_completion for the finetuned model
    - `llama_version: [llama3]`: Select the Llama3 model

Ensure you follow these guidelines to successfully run the Llama3-70B demo.
